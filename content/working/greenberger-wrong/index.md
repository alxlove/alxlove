abstract: "Consistent and well-documented racial disparities in policing are often conceived of as being the product of an interaction between individual officer-level racial bias and the race of the person being stopped. Less clearly understood is how the macro-political environment shapes the way officers interact with individuals. We investigate whether place-based bias exists in policing by comparing police behavior cross-sectionally across precinct boundaries. We find that police engage in more crime-prevention behavior in certain precincts and that these behaviors are associated with the racial demographics of the precinct, not the level of crime or demand for service. We use a geographic discontinuity design to determine whether bias arises in response to neighborhood or precinct considerationsâ€”we find that place-based bias stems from beliefs about precincts. While we cannot determine if these beliefs arise because of direction from police administration or beliefs held by officers, these results suggest that administrative policies may be an effective remedy to counter racial disparities in policing that exist due to place-based bias."
