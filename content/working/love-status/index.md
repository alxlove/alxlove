abstract: "While extensive research explores how interested parties influence rulemaking procedures within Americaâ€™s federal agencies, current literature often neglects the contextual backdrop against which rule amendments are proposed. Most rule proposals are not isolated actions, but rather, attempts to modify existing regulation. This paper identifies the status quo policy for over 800 rules spanning 2017 to 2023, employing text analysis to quantify both the initially proposed changes by agencies and the alterations finalized post comment period. I find that changes made after the comment period account for a small percentage of overall changes to U.S. regulations and that in the most significant cases, they predominately move the proposed policy closer to the status quo. This study not only probes the tangible impact of notice and comment rulemaking on federal regulations but also explores how participatory structures in rulemaking may potentially bias policy outcomes, prompting key questions regarding democratic participation and policy evolution in the regulatory process."
