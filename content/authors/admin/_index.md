Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021, and my B.A. in Public Policy and Data Analytics from [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu) in 2019. 

My research is centered around the decision-making processes of non-elected government officials and the implications these decisions have on inequality across the United States. My dissertation explores the capacity of interest groups to shape the federal rulemaking process. Beyond rulemaking, my interests extend to law enforcement practices, particularly examining the decision-making criteria of police officers during traffic stops and the resultant racially disparate outcomes.

I use a variety of methods in my research including text analysis, multilevel regression, and machine learning. I love collecting new datasets of administrative data and regularly use [open records requests](foia.gov) to discover and analyze new data.

You can read some of my work in *Perspectives on Politics* and *American Criminal Law Review*.
